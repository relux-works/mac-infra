# mac-infra

macOS operations tooling and agent skills for local workstation maintenance.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Command | Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mac-audio-reset` | Diagnose and reset CoreAudio glitches without rebooting the Mac | `mac-audio-reset diagnose`, `mac-audio-reset reset --dry-run`, `mac-audio-reset reset` | none; diagnostic output only |
| `mac-infra-core` | Privileged LaunchDaemon helper for allowlisted macOS maintenance actions | `mac-infra-core install`, `mac-infra-core status`, `mac-infra-core uninstall` | `/Library/LaunchDaemons/works.relux.mac-infra-core.plist`, `/var/run/works.relux.mac-infra-core.sock` |
| `go test` | Verify Go command planning and CLI behavior | `go test ./...` | test cache only |
| `scripts/setup.sh` | Build the CLIs and install global skill symlinks | `./scripts/setup.sh` | `bin/mac-audio-reset`, `bin/mac-infra-core`, `~/.local/bin/*`, `~/.agents/skills/mac-infra`, `~/.codex/skills/mac-infra`, `~/.claude/skills/mac-infra` |
| `scripts/deinit.sh` | Remove user-level installation | `./scripts/deinit.sh` | removes symlinks and runtime skill copy |

## Audio Reset Workflow

Use this when macOS audio starts crackling or distorting and restarting the player app is not enough.

```bash
mac-audio-reset diagnose
mac-audio-reset reset --dry-run
mac-infra-core install
mac-audio-reset reset
```

The reset path shuts down booted iOS simulators first, then restarts CoreAudio. This targets the common failure mode where Simulator audio, Apple Music, and high sample-rate USB or Bluetooth output leave CoreAudio in an underrun-prone state.

`mac-infra-core` is intentionally not a generic command runner. The daemon accepts only fixed JSON actions over its Unix socket and executes hardcoded absolute-path commands without shell evaluation.
